In this first chapter are introduced the core definitions that will be used as "axioms" for the rest of the book.
The first thing is the hierarchy composed of: 
1) entities 
2) species 
3) genera.  

An entity is an individual thing. Can be abstract or concrete. (example the number 2)
A species is a description of a set of properties in common in a set of entities. (example natural number)
A genus is a description of a set of properties in common in a set of species. (example number)
We work on entities using functions. A function is a rule that associates one or more entities (same or different
species) to a one entity. To get in the concrete, entities are values, species are types and genera are concepts.
Working with concepts can lead to reusability of the code, more optimization and flexibility because we are working on a set of types that satisfy a set of requirements and not a specific concrete type. (For more about concepts check the file concept.hpp).
