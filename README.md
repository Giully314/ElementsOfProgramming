# ElementsOfProgramming

## About
Elements of programming talks about writing code based on mathematical foundations. With the right level of abstraction code can be easily reusable, secure and optimizable based on concepts (on of the core idea of the book). Even though the focus of the book is about algorithms, I'm programming data structures using the 
same ideas.  


## Thoughts
Concepts are my favorite feature of C++20. They allow the definition of requirements on types on a level of abstraction that i find it beautiful and useful.
Note that the focus of this project is not to learn the syntax or the tricks on how to implement concepts 
or type_traits but to understand the abstraction and the hierarchy of properties on types.
I will use the standard library for basic concepts and type_traits to avoid to move the focus on other things.
